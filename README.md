# Chartlytics-Backend
An application for the visually impaired that solves the problem of screen readers where they are unable to read the chart content from chart images.
Our proposed solution supports data extraction from four types of charts:
<ol>
<li>Pie Charts
<li>Line Charts
<li>Horizontal Bar Charts
<li>Vertical Bar Charts
</ol>
The app includes a functionality that converts written text into spoken words, which leads the user through the app.
<h2>This repository contains: </h2>
<ul>
<li>The classification model used to classify the chart type
<li>The object detection model used to identify chart components
<li>Data extraction code that is used to extract the raw data from the chart by using Rule-Based techniques.
</ul>
